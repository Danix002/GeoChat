Collektive MQTT Application

This application leverages the Collektive library to model a decentralized communication system based on spatial proximity. Connected devices can send and receive messages within a global chat, provided they are within a certain distance of each other.
The project is currently under development and offers a minimal working version as a proof of concept.
